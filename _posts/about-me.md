As a Product CMS Developer at Scorpion Enterprises LLC, I help build scalable content management systems using modern web technologies. My work empowers businesses across various industries with efficient, user-friendly solutions.

My tech journey includes roles at Apple and Infosys, providing technical support and solutions to individuals and SMBs. At Firm Collective, I led the One Accord App development, managing both technical implementation and team coordination. Currently, I'm pursuing an MBA with Cybersecurity emphasis at Southern Utah University, an AACSB-accredited institution, aiming to help protect America's digital resources.

Through faith and determination, I transformed personal challenges into opportunities for growth. Today, I combine technical expertise with a passion for mentoring aspiring developers.
