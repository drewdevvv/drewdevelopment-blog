My tech journey reflects the ever-evolving nature of web development. Starting with the MERN stack in bootcamp, I've explored various technologies and approaches:

## Technology Evolution
- MERN → Next.js/TypeScript
- Firebase → AWS/Cloudflare
- Basic React → Enterprise Architecture
- Manual Testing → Automated CI/CD
- Traditional Development → AI-Enhanced Development

## Learning Through Gaps
Periods of reduced activity taught me valuable lessons. Each return to coding brought fresh perspectives and new technologies to master. The key is persistence - technology evolves, and so do we.

## Current Focus
I'm now building with cloud-native technologies, particularly Cloudflare Workers and AI integration. My repositories show this progression:
- Early projects: Basic CRUD applications
- Recent work: Cloud-native solutions with AI capabilities
- Current exploration: JetBrains AI tools, Cloudflare integrations

The best developers stay adaptable and embrace change. Skills can be learned, but curiosity and resilience are invaluable.
