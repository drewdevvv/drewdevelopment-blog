There are many things I wanted to be as a grown-up when I was a child. None of them included developing websites and software engineering. I saw various family members build PCs growing up and thought the closest I would ever get is playing backyard baseball on windows and later Halo on Xbox. I know I'm aging myself to some of you reading this. For others, my fellow brethren, I am assured by your shared nostalgia. When COVID covered the globe I raced to an opportunity to journey into software development. This led me to a coding bootcamp through Bethel College. 
This coding bootcamp changed my life. I learned Kingdom foundations founded in the Love of Jesus - these values intertwined with critical problem solving and foundational practices in software development launched me into my new passion.
