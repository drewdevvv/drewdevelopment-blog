## Projects
My first project I worked on as a freelancer is [The Dolorosa site and CMS](https://thedolorosa.com)

This project was my introduction to webflow. After bootcamp I discovered headless CMS's and no-code platforms that allowed the ability for less technicaly users to manage content on a site in an efficient way. Webflow allowed me to get practice on creating custom forms and ways to organize/manage users in a seamless way. Adding new tattoo artists and customized content for each artist allowed a simple workflow and sustainable system.
