At the age of 8, my life changed forever when my father passed away, leaving my mother to raise four children on her own. The strength I witnessed in my mother as she navigated this challenging time taught me invaluable lessons about resilience and determination. Growing up in these circumstances, I learned early on about perseverance and resourcefulness. Through my struggles and journey to sobriety, I found a new relationship with my Higher Power and discovered my passion for technology while reigniting my curiosity about nonprofit work.

At Scorpion Enterprises LLC, I channel these life experiences into everything I do. Scorpion's stack is incredible and has given me in-depth experience with proprietary software. The team is full of geniuses from .NET to React, from Sales to Engineering. My journey of overcoming obstacles has given me a unique insight into creating solutions that truly serve people's needs. I support and maintain robust proprietary systems that streamline content workflows and drive marketing success across diverse sectors, including Healthcare and Franchise. Finally developing key features, implementing optimizations, and ensuring a seamless connection between front-end interfaces and back-end queries is an honor and joy to do.

My tech journey includes roles at Apple and Infosys, where I provided technical support and solutions to individuals and SMBs. Side projects and volunteering keep me fresh! The opportunity at Firm Collective, where I led the One Accord App authentication team, directing the team coordination and leading cross-collaboration with UI/UX, cybersecurity, and data science teams is a great example of this.

Currently, I'm pursuing an MBA with Cybersecurity emphasis at Southern Utah University, an AACSB-accredited institution. My goal is to help protect America's digital resources, driven by the same determination that helped me overcome personal challenges.

My path to sobriety taught me that transformation is possible through faith, determination, and support from others. Today, I combine my technical expertise with a passion for helping others, especially those facing their own challenges. My journey reminds me daily that our greatest struggles can become our greatest strengths, a lesson I first learned watching my mother raise four children on her own.
