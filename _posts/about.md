At the age of 8, my life changed forever when my father passed away, leaving my mother to raise four children on her own. The strength I witnessed in my mother as she navigated this challenging time taught me invaluable lessons about resilience and determination. Growing up in these circumstances, I learned early on about perseverance and resourcefulness. Through my own personal struggles and journey to sobriety, I discovered that technology could be both my anchor and path forward.

At Scorpion Enterprises LLC, I channel these life experiences into developing innovative content management systems built on .NET, with several services now in React. My journey of overcoming obstacles has given me unique insight into creating solutions that truly serve people's needs. I support and maintain robust systems that streamline content workflows and drive marketing success across diverse sectors. This includes developing key features, implementing optimizations, and ensuring system reliability to meet evolving business needs.:

Healthcare: Drawing from my own experiences navigating healthcare systems, I help develop CMS solutions that make a real difference - from small clinics to large hospital networks across the United States. These systems enable healthcare providers to manage patient information, appointment scheduling, and online communication more effectively, ultimately improving patient care and operational efficiency.

Franchise: My background taught me the importance of community and supporting others. I bring this perspective to developing scalable CMS solutions that empower franchisees both nationally and internationally. These tools help them manage local marketing efforts, maintain brand consistency, and effectively reach their communities.

My tech journey includes roles at Apple and Infosys, where I provided technical support and solutions to individuals and SMBs. The discipline I gained through recovery helped me excel at Firm Collective, where I led the One Accord App development, managing both technical implementation and team coordination.

Currently, I'm pursuing an MBA with Cybersecurity emphasis at Southern Utah University, an AACSB-accredited institution. My goal is to help protect America's digital resources, driven by the same determination that helped me overcome personal challenges.

My path to sobriety taught me that transformation is possible through faith, determination, and support from others. Today, I combine my technical expertise with a passion for helping others, especially those facing their own challenges. My journey reminds me daily that our greatest struggles can become our greatest strengths, a lesson I first learned watching my mother raise four children on her own.
